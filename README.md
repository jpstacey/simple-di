# Simple DI

Simple dependency injection principles, demonstrated by a gradual process of improvement.

Branches as follows:

* 0.x - hardwired "new" statements, no DI
* 1.x - centralized "new" statements, property injection
* 1.x - centralized "new" statements, setter injection
* 2.x - centralized "new" statements, constructor injection
